# Mongo API Project
This was a project made during the Technigo bootcamp. The aim was to use a database to store and retrieve data from, and use that data to produce a RESTful API. 

## My project
I used a dataset about bookreviews. My API contains queries for filtering on author, title and language, and if neither is queried all books/objects will be shown. If the query doesn't return a result the API will show an empty array. I made params to find ID and ISBN. If nothing is found an error message is shown. There's also an endpoint to get a top-10 list of books with highest average rating in reviews. 

## Techs/tools used
